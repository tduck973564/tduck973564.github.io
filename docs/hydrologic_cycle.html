                <h1>Precipitation</h1>
                <p>The life of a water droplet starts when it falls from the sky. It starts as a small little droplet in a cloud, but then it gets connected to other droplets after the air around it becomes saturated, and becomes heavy. This extra weight causes it to fall out of it's cloud. It falls at blistering speeds, eventually hitting the ground, as it goes onto the next stage of it's life.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="child" id="runoff">
                <h1>Run-Off and Infiltration</h1>
                <p>The water droplet smashes onto the ground and runs across the ground as fast as it can, because if it slows down it will soak into the ground. The path is very smooth and steep allowing it to move fast across the ground, stopping it infiltrating. Some other droplets don't have this privilege though.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="child" id="percolation">
                <h1>Percolation and Groundwater</h1>
                <p>The droplet lost some of it's body to infiltration, but it isn't all that bad underground. It would end back up in the sea anyway. It either percolates, which is moving through the ground to get back to the sea, or becomes groundwater stuck between the pores of pervious rocks, soil and sand, which will be taken up by plants and evaporated, or extracted from an aquifer (an underground rock formation with water).</p>
            </section>
            <section class="child" id="evaporation">
                <h1>Evaporation and Transpiration</h1>
                <p>The droplet eventually ends up with all its friends in either a plant leaf or a body of water, but this is short lived, because the droplet starts to heat up. It evaporates to become water vapour, rising up back to the heavens to be reborn as another droplet.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="child" id="condensation">
                <h1>Condensation</h1>
                <p>The new droplet starts to form, rising up into the sky as it starts to condense into a new droplet. It's life just began right when it ended. The air around it eventually becomes saturated, clumping with other droplets in the final stage of it's birth, going right back to the start.</p>
