<h1>My Comfort Food</h1>
<div class="text-block">
<h2>My ultimate comfort food</h2>
<p>My ultimate comfort food has to be burgers. I love burgers because they taste so nice and have so much flavour. They are also really filling and make me feel bloated after an especially big one.<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.cfee5e3a2df626101dff3c546b52f99f?rik=m7JxwYDxk0csyg&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.readersdigest.ca%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f11%2fgourmet-burger.jpg&amp;ehk=rkRu6XYjGWaKdF%2f%2fRax0o00Xt84b6WWZbYUQ1WT0ETw%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw" width="400"/></p>

<h2>The food most popular in lockdown</h2>
<p>Pasta, soup <s>and toilet paper</s>, because when there was a lot of panic buying, those were the things that were usually lacking on the shelves and out of stock. I still don't know why people panic bought toilet paper, or even why toilet paper still exists, bidets are so much better (no I don't have one).</p>

<h2>Things I want to learn in Food Studies</h2>
<p>The first thing is probably how to make pizza, because I really like pizzas. The second thing has to be how to make chips, because I also like chips. The third thing is how to be safe in the kitchen, because a few undesirable things have happened when I have cooked.</p>
