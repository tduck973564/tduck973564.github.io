<p>Hi! I'm Thomas, known as tduck973564 on <a href="https://github.com/tduck973564">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/427702345879781377">Discord.</a></p>
<p>I'm a noob programmer who mainly programs in Python and Rust, but in the future I would like to learn C and Bash. I love tweaking around with computers and Linux especially. I use Fedora Linux 34, with the KDE Plasma desktop.</p>
<p>My preferred code editor is Visual Studio Code, with the default theme. I have tried to use emacs and vim before, but nothing beats the ease of use of a graphical code editor. Ironically, I really don't like coding graphical user interfaces in anything other than HTML and CSS. I prefer to develop in the backend, although I will have to write some frontend programs in the future. </p>
<p>My favourite programming language has to be Rust, as it teaches me good programming practices while also being fun to use.</p>
